# Internship at Celebal Technologies - SQL Department

## Overview
During my internship at **Celebal Technologies**, I had the opportunity to work on real-world projects within the **SQL department**. This experience provided hands-on exposure to advanced SQL techniques, database management, and query optimization. Below are some of the key areas I contributed to and learned during my time at Celebal Technologies.

## Key Learnings & Contributions

### SQL Database Design
- **Overview**:  
  Developed and optimized database schemas for various applications, focusing on data normalization and ensuring data integrity across multiple tables and relationships.
  
### Advanced SQL Queries
- **Joins, Subqueries, and Aggregations**:  
  Worked extensively with complex SQL queries using **INNER**, **LEFT**, and **RIGHT joins**, as well as subqueries and nested queries to retrieve data efficiently.
- **Aggregate Functions**:  
  Utilized SQL aggregate functions like **SUM()**, **COUNT()**, **AVG()**, and **GROUP BY** to analyze large datasets and produce meaningful insights.

### Query Optimization
- **Indexing**:  
  Implemented indexing strategies to improve the speed and performance of SQL queries.
- **Execution Plans**:  
  Analyzed execution plans to detect slow queries and optimized them for faster performance and reduced resource usage.
  
### Stored Procedures & Functions
- **Stored Procedures**:  
  Created stored procedures to automate repetitive tasks and enhance query performance.
- **User-Defined Functions (UDFs)**:  
  Developed UDFs to modularize and reuse SQL logic across multiple queries and procedures.

### Data Security and Backup
- **Data Security**:  
  Implemented role-based access control (RBAC) and data encryption to ensure secure access and storage of sensitive information.
- **Backup & Recovery**:  
  Learned and applied techniques for database backup, disaster recovery, and restoration processes to minimize data loss risks.

### Data Migration & ETL Processes
- **ETL Pipelines**:  
  Worked on **Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)** processes for data migration between different systems, ensuring data accuracy and consistency during the transfer.
  
### Database Management Systems (DBMS)
- **Microsoft SQL Server**:  
  Used Microsoft SQL Server for database management, focusing on its capabilities for large-scale data handling and robust security features.
  
## Certification
I successfully completed the internship and received certification from **Celebal Technologies**, solidifying my expertise in SQL database management and query optimization.
